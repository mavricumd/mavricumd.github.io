                    <p>Smart investment in such a rapidly changing field requires two things:  knowing what is and will be possible along a foreseeable timeline, and understanding the business requirements and economics of the target market(s). MAVRIC addresses both of these needs so that our Partners are able to focus on the work they do best.</p>

                    <p>MAVRIC maintains the constant connections with leading thinkers, scholars, and inventors that allows us to stay on the forefront of such a rapidly changing wave. This involves thuppoe usual conferences (including virtual, of course) and roundtable participation, but also reviews of the research of both the fundamental technologies involved (Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Rendering Methods, miniaturization, battery tech, etc.) and regular discussions with leading scientists and researchers in the field.</p>

                <p>However, even knowing the right technology for the right use case is not sufficient. MAVRIC also dives into the fundamental economics of each industry and company to understand its drivers of adoption, financial structures, and its purchasing and decision processes. Only by understanding the customer at this level is it possible to create products that will resonate and succeed.</p>
                <p>In addition, MAVRIC provides direct support to our partner startups and growth companies across the entire spectrum of accelerator activities from market analysis and consulting to operational planning to pitch deck and investment connections.</p>
